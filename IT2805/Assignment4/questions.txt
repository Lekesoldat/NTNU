Mention some of the advantages of having a single responsive website instead of dedicated versions like m.til.no for mobile and til.no for desktop?
    A:
    
    Responsive sites save the content and are easier to maintain. A single site with a single content repository is way easier to maintain than different sites with different repositories. 

    Responsive sites are device-specific. A responsive site will work on a range of device screens, - from phones to desktops. You do not have to develop a specific site for both mobiles and desktops. 

    Responsive sites are easier to find for search engines. Mobile-sites usually have a different URL than the main page itself, - a responsive site will have the same URL regardless of device.
