Not what I expected from a security-course. Did not really learn anything interesting. What was taught felt rather obvious, and huge diversity in the grading of the subjects. Similar solutions and arguments got graded very differently, which was rather frustrating for many.

# TTM4185 - Sikkerhet og robusthet i IKT-system

## Wordlist

ICT: _Information and Communication Technology_  
Resillient society: _The society's ability to carry on despite of a crisis._  
Isomorpic graphs: _Two identical graphs._

## Lecture 1

**Communication technology:** The fundamental enabling technology which is crucial for a lot of technical solutions. These are necessary to provided services that are critical for a resillient society.

**What is a central node in a graph (Centrality)?**  
A node that is close to other nodes. The more central a node is, the closer it is to all other nodes. Its a measure of the importance of a vertex.

Degree centrality: _The number of vertices that a given vertex is connected to._  
Closeness centrality: _Total distance from a vertex to all other vertices in the network._  
Betweenness centrality: _Number of paths between each pair of vertices that pass through a vertex._
