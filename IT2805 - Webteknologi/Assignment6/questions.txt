Why does the following expression 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3 evaluate to false in Javascript?
    A:
    Because triple equals is for strict comparisons. In JS 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3000000.. and NOT 0.3. 

What does the method attribute on a form element decide?
    A:
    It decides which method to transfer the data. Either with POST or GET.

Explain why the form fields appear in the URL when the method on form element is changed to GET ?
    A:
    The GET method appends the form-data to the URL in name/value pairs. It is really bad practice to use the GET method
    when sending sensitive information.
    The POST method on the other hand appends the form-data in the body of the HTTP-request. 

Why is it considered bad practice to only validate form input with HTML5 and/or Javascript?
    A: 
    When you submit the data, it can be tempered with. The JS or HTML might also make an error, but if you have an extra layer of validation to check
    if the data is actually correct you'll experience less errors and tempered data.

When is it appropriate to use textarea over input ?
    A: 
    When you want to type longer text-inputs. The input type 'text' has a character-limitation, and even though you can type rather large inputs it's better practice to use 'textarea'. You can resize the text-area and show multiple lines instead of the one line from a regular 'text'-input.
