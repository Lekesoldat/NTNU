=== Modeling Tools

| At some point in the modelling process, you may notice that one of the 
languages is better suited for your case. If so, after modelling 3 aspects in 
both languages, you can select one of the languages to continue modelling 
with. Explain the reasons for your choice.

| You should be able to explain why you think one approach/language is better 
suited to model your case. Note: it may be that both are equally suitable. 
Reflect on the modelling choices you have made by comparing the two 
modelling languages and explain. Are there other features that you would 
have like to have in a modelling tool?
