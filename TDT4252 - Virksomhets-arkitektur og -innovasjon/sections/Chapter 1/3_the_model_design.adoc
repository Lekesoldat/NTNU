=== Model Design

The enterprise models presented are mostly concerned with the business process.
By concentrating on the business process, one may see both the important procedures and the individuals involved.
The goals are also significant since they serve as the reason why the tasks are carried out.

To begin developing the models, I concentrated on the processes.
It was critical to have a thorough grasp of how a Kiosken operates.
When the processes with it's sub processes was modeled, I focused on the goals.
To begin, I had some rough thoughts about the goals, but when the processes was clear, the goals were concretized and split into subgoals. 
Once the processes were identified, the actors manifested themselves intuitively.
To avoid extraneous information, the models incorporate just relevant actors. 

The enterprise model was created using a top-down method.
The goals are provided first, followed by the procedures and the essential actors.
The model's user is supposed to first comprehend the goals, then what is currently happening and what may be improved. 

Both 4EM and ArchiMate employ comparable perspectives in this case.
The perspectives chosen were the most appropriate for the model and situation.
Because we were only going to use one modeling language for the report, having similar models aided us in deciding on a language.
