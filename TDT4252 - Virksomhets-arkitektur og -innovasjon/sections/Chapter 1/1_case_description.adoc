=== Case Description

The selected case and its focus will be on the student association, Online. 
Online is one of the most significant student associations at NTNU, with nearly a thousand active members. 
Hierarchically, Online is built up by several committees, some larger than others. 
Out of the nearly thousand active members, at least 160 of them are committee members powering Online. 

The case will specifically target a process in one of the committees - Trikom. 
Trikom is the committee for well-being. 
The committee is in charge of the kiosk at Online's office and organizes smaller social events, to mention some.

'''

The case itself regards the kiosk, hereafter called 'Kiosken.' 
Kiosken has a relatively broad selection of both snacks and soft drinks. 
Students purchase these items through an internal economy connected to the student ID cards.

Students would like to have all items available at all times. 
However, through some research and personal experiences, it is clear that the availability of items is unpredictable. 
Students experience empty shelves of their favorite snacks for an extensive period, and there is no
way of knowing when a restock happens.

As for the committee members of Trikom, there are several annoyances as well.
The restocking process appears to be quite comprehensive and unpredictable.
'When will it happen,' 'who is responsible,' and 'who does what' are frequently asked questions. 
Further, it appears to be much micromanagement which in an ideal world would not exist.

As a member of Online, I am a frequent user of Kiosken. 
The problems mentioned above significantly impact me as a regular customer. 
My biggest motivation for the presented case is to figure out how to streamline the restocking process and thus provide better and more predictable availability of the goods in Kiosken. 

By utilizing an enterprise model, from Trikom's perspective, one can hopefully understand the underlying processes of the restocking and identify innovations to streamline those.
