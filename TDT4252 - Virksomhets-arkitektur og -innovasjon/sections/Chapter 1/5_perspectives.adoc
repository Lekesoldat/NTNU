=== Perspectives/Aspects

|===
| Expectations |Theory related

| The model should include at least three perspectives/aspects of an 
enterprise in both 4EM and ArchiMate. Enterprise models by definition 
contain models of several perspectives (referred to also as sub-models), and 
they relate to one another. Note that the relationships across the 
perspectives are very important.

| In your report, you should  explain them and how they relate to one another. 
An Enterprise model vs. several models of a single aspect is important here; 
hence the relationships across the different aspects and layers must be 
described and explained. The student should demonstrate that they 
understand the relevance of the relationships across the different aspects.
