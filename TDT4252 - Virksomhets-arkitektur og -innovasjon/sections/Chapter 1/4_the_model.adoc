// |===
// | Expectations |Theory related

// | Models in ArchiMate AND 4EM. The actual model(s) must be submitted 
// along with the report (Visio, LucidChart, Archimate, etc.). The report should 
// include screen shots of the model with relevant explanations.

// | The textual descriptions of your model should explain the non-obvious parts. 
// The model should for the most part explain it self.
