=== Design of the Model

==== 4EM Models

[[em_goal]]
.Goal Model || 4EM
image::figures/ASIS/4EM_2-Goals.png[GOALS]

Trikom's overarching goal is to "increase the availability of items in Kiosken."
The inefficient restocking process, which is the key bottleneck of item supply, must be streamlined. 
Goals for streamlining the restocking process include reducing the number of steps in the restocking and automating the detection of need.
Opportunities as well as threats are addressed.
Further, possible constraints are highlighted. 

[[em_process]]
.Business Process Model || 4EM
image::figures/ASIS/4EM_2-Process.png[PROCESS]

The *Business Process View* is more in-depth.
The view depicts the case's important processes as well as the actors involved.
xref:processes[] provides a more detailed explanation of the processes and what is happening.
It is worth noting that the information sets are important as the output of each process is essential for the next.

[[em_actors]]
.Actors and Resources Model || 4EM
image::figures/ASIS/4EM_2-Actors.png[ACTORS]

This perspective depicts the many organizational units, roles, and resources.
Furthermore, the model's user gains an understanding of how the various pieces are linked.

The Enterprise View depicts all pertinent information about the case.
The processes are linked to the goals, and which actors do what.
The model provides a high-level overview of Trikom's operations. 


==== ArchiMate Models

.Organizational View || ArchiMate
image::figures/ASIS/AM_2_Organizational_View.svg[]

This view is straightforward.
It displays the case's relevant actors and the placement within the organization Online.

.Motivational View || ArchiMate
image::figures/ASIS/AM_2_Motivational_Viewpoint.svg[]

This view displays the drivers and overall goals. 
Constraints and assessments are included.

.Business Process View || ArchiMate
image::figures/ASIS/AM_2_Business_Process_View.svg[]

The important processes, as in the 4EM-model (xref:em_process[]), are presented, together with the appropriate actors.
The absence of information sets is a significant distinction between this model and the 4EM model. 

.Enterprise View || ArchiMate
image::figures/ASIS/AM_2_EM.svg[]

The enterprise model illustrated here, like xref:em_em[], incorporates all important information for the case.
It is clear how the drives and goals are related to the actors and processes. 

// |===
// | Expectations |Theory related

// | Models in ArchiMate AND 4EM. The actual model(s) must be submitted 
// along with the report (Visio, LucidChart, Archimate, etc.). The report should 
// include screen shots of the model with relevant explanations.

// | The textual descriptions of your model should explain the non-obvious parts. 
// The model should for the most part explain it self.
