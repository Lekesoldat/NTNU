==== 4EM Models

.Goal Model || 4EM

Trikom's overarching goal is to "increase the availability of items in Kiosken."
The inefficient restocking process, which is the key bottleneck of item supply, must be streamlined. 
Goals for streamlining the restocking process include reducing the number of steps in the restocking and automating the detection of need.
Opportunities as well as threats are addressed.
Further, possible constraints are highlighted. 

.Business Process View || 4EM

The business process view is more in-depth.
The view depicts the case's important steps as well as the people involved.
Section xref:processes[] provides a more detailed explanation of the processes.

// |===
// | Expectations |Theory related

// | Models in ArchiMate AND 4EM. The actual model(s) must be submitted 
// along with the report (Visio, LucidChart, Archimate, etc.). The report should 
// include screen shots of the model with relevant explanations.

// | The textual descriptions of your model should explain the non-obvious parts. 
// The model should for the most part explain it self.
