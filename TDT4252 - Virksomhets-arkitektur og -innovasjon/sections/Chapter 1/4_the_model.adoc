=== Design of the Model

==== 4EM Models

[[em_goal]]
.Goal Model || 4EM
image::figures/ASIS/4EM-Goals.svg[GOALS]

Trikom's overarching goal is to 'Increase customer satisfaction.' 
This goal is difficult to measure, and it may never be considered as _reached_ simply because. 
However, having this as the main goal makes a it easier to create supporting and achievable sub-goals.
The sub-goals to achieve this is given as 'Increasing the variety of items in stock', or by 'increasing the availability of items.'
The inefficient restocking process, which is the key bottleneck of item supply, must be streamlined. 
It is the increased availability-part that will be the focus of this report.
Goals for streamlining the restocking process include reducing the number of steps in the restocking and automating the detection of need.
Opportunities as well as threats are addressed.
Further, possible constraints are highlighted. 


[[em_process]]
.Business Process Model || 4EM

<<<
The *Business Process Model* is more in-depth.
The view depicts the case's important processes as well as the actor involved.
xref:processes[] provides a more detailed explanation of the processes and what is happening.
It is worth noting that the _information sets_ are important, as the output of each process is essential for the next.


[[em_actors]]
.Actors and Resources Model || 4EM
image::figures/ASIS/4EM-Actors.svg[ACTORS]

This perspective depicts the many organizational units, roles, and resources.
Furthermore, the model's user gains an understanding of how the various pieces are linked.
xref:model_design[] goes a bit more into detail regarding the use of this model.

.Enterprise Model || 4EM

The Enterprise View depicts all pertinent information about the case.
The processes are linked to the goals, and which actors do what.
The model provides a high-level overview of Trikom's operations, and how Dotkom can be utilized to reach the goals. 

==== ArchiMate Models

.Motivational View || ArchiMate
image::figures/ASIS/AM_Motivational_Viewpoint.svg[]

This view displays the drivers and overall goals. 
Constraints and assessments are included.
The description of the goals are the same as for xref:em_goal[].


.Business Process View || ArchiMate
image::figures/ASIS/AM_Business_Process_View.svg[]

The important processes, as in the 4EM-model (xref:em_process[]), are presented, together with the appropriate actors.
The absence of information sets is a significant distinction between this model and the 4EM model. 


.Organizational View || ArchiMate
image::figures/ASIS/AM_Organizational_View.svg[]

This view is straightforward.
It displays the case's relevant actors and the placement within the organization Online.
xref:model_design[] looks more into the utilization of this view.


.Enterprise View || ArchiMate
image::figures/ASIS/AM_EM.svg[]

The enterprise model illustrated here, like xref:em_em[], incorporates all important information for the case.
It is clear how the drives and goals are related to the actors and processes. 

// |===
// | Expectations |Theory related

// | Models in ArchiMate AND 4EM. The actual model(s) must be submitted 
// along with the report (Visio, LucidChart, Archimate, etc.). The report should 
// include screen shots of the model with relevant explanations.

// | The textual descriptions of your model should explain the non-obvious parts. 
// The model should for the most part explain it self.
