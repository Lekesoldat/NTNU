=== Using the Model
|===
| Expectations |Theory related

| How would you use your model? "Views" are how you would "extract" 
some information from your model for a particular purpose. E.g. A view that 
serves a specific sub-goal for your model. Or what a specific 
stakeholder/user would like to see or what is relevant in a specific situation. 
How would you use the model to obtain such a view?  The answer expected 
here must include a discussion of the view and how the model is used to get.

| You should be able to explain why you think one approach/language is better 
suited to model your case. Note: it may be that both are equally suitable. 
Reflect on the modelling choices you have made by comparing the two 
modelling languages and explain. Are there other features that you would 
have like to have in a modelling tool?
