=== Purpose/Goal of the Model

|===
| Expectations |Theory related

| Why are you modeling? How would the model address your case? What 
purpose would your model serve? Note: this is very important for evaluating 
the model as your model should be evaluated against this.

| This must be very clear and well scoped. Sub-goals are also important. (Note: 
goals of the model, not the enterprise you're modelling.) What are the success 
criteria for your model? How would you know if/when the purpose of the 
model is fulfilled - connection to evaluation of the model? Who wil be the 
main users and beneficiaries of the model?
