=== Purpose/Goal 

The current models give a precise overview of the relevant parts of the case AS IS.
The purpose is to give valuable insight into the details of the restock process regarding essential actors, resources, goals, and processes. 
No unnecessary information will surface, and the models have a logical easy-to-follow structure.

By following the models, one could hopefully discover weak points of the processes
through analysis and research and adjust accordingly.

// | Expectations |Theory related

// | Why are you modeling? How would the model address your case? What 
// purpose would your model serve? Note: this is very important for evaluating 
// the model as your model should be evaluated against this.

// | This must be very clear and well scoped. Sub-goals are also important. (Note: 
// goals of the model, not the enterprise you're modelling.) What are the success 
// criteria for your model? How would you know if/when the purpose of the 
// model is fulfilled - connection to evaluation of the model? Who wil be the 
// main users and beneficiaries of the model?
