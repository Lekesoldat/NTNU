=== The Model
|===
| Expectations |Theory related

| Models in ArchiMate AND 4EM. The actual model(s) must be submitted 
along with the report (Visio, LucidChart, Archimate, etc.). The report should 
include screen shots of the model with relevant explanations.

| The textual descriptions of your model should explain the non-obvious parts. 
The model should for the most part explain it self.
