=== The Model and it's Design

The presented enterprise models are primarily concerned with the business process.
By concentrating on the business process, one may see both the important procedures and the individuals involved.
The goals are also crucial since they act as the motivation for completing the duties.

Similar views are utilized in both 4EM and ArchiMate.
The perspectives were the most appropriate for the model and case.
As we were only going to use one modeling language for the report, having similar models helped me decide on a language.

// along with the report (Visio, LucidChart, Archimate, etc.). The report should 
// include screen shots of the model with relevant explanations.
