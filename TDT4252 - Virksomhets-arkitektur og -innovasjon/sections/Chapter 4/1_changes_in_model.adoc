=== Changes in the Enterprise Model

The models will be redesigned in this section to complement the planned innovation.
Changes will be made to the 4EM-model, which will have an impact on both the Actors and Resources Model and the Business Process Model.

// | Identify the changes that you have to make in your enterprise to realise the 
// business model and deliver the services. Enhance your 4EM or Archimate 
// model from part 1. The new model should be submitted. (Hint: did the 
// service innovation create more goals for your enterprise? If so, are there 
// implications for the processes, roles, technology, etc. in your enterprise?)

// | Explain the changes in your enterprise model and how they would support the service innovation e.g. new or changed processes, new organisational 
// structure, new competences and therefore new roles and actors, perhaps new 
// technological solutions, etc.). Note: again, it's important to be clear about the 
// purpose of the model as was relevant for part 1.
