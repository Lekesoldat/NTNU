=== Changes in the Enterprise Model

| Expectations |Theory related

| Identify the changes that you have to make in your enterprise to realise the 
business model and deliver the services. Enhance your 4EM or Archimate 
model from part 1. The new model should be submitted. (Hint: did the 
service innovation create more goals for your enterprise? If so, are there 
implications for the processes, roles, technology, etc. in your enterprise?)

| Explain the changes in your enterprise model and how they would support the service innovation e.g. new or changed processes, new organisational 
structure, new competences and therefore new roles and actors, perhaps new 
technological solutions, etc.). Note: again, it's important to be clear about the 
purpose of the model as was relevant for part 1.
