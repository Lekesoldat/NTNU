=== Changes in the Enterprise Model

The models will be redesigned in this section to complement the planned innovation.
Changes will be made to the 4EM-models.
The affected models are both the Actors and Resources Model and the Business Process Model. 
Naturally this affects the Enterprise Model as well.
All notable changes in the models are highlighted with red borders (does not include constraints in Goal model).

// | Identify the changes that you have to make in your enterprise to realise the 
// business model and deliver the services. Enhance your 4EM or Archimate 
// model from part 1. The new model should be submitted. (Hint: did the 
// service innovation create more goals for your enterprise? If so, are there 
// implications for the processes, roles, technology, etc. in your enterprise?)

// | Explain the changes in your enterprise model and how they would support the service innovation e.g. new or changed processes, new organisational 
// structure, new competences and therefore new roles and actors, perhaps new 
// technological solutions, etc.). Note: again, it's important to be clear about the 
// purpose of the model as was relevant for part 1.
