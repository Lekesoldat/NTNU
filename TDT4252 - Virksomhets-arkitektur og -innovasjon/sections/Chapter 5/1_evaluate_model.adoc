=== Model Evaluation
In this section I will evaluate the models created. In xref:goals[] I described the goals, sub-goals and purpose as the following:

. The model should *be beneficial to analyze the business processes*

.. It should be able to *identify possible innovation(s)*

.. 1.2 It should *identify potential threats to reach the business goals*

. The model should overall *visualize*

.. It should be *created in such a way that the committe members of Trikom is able to utilize it*

To evaluate the models I will use *quality criteria*. 
*Quality criteria* are utilized because, while it focuses on the models and how accurate they are in terms of modeling the business, it allows for subjective quality. 
I.e it covers the models usability and understanding, which are very important parts for those going to utilize them.


According to Krogstie et al., 'what quality criteria are relevant and how strictly they are to be followed depends on the purpose of modeling or goals of modeling' cite:[krogstie], and this is taken into consideration for this section. 
In xref:success_criteria[] I aimed at *usability* and *understanding*, and followingly this will be the focus now.

NOTE: All definitions in the following paragraphs are by Sandkuhl et al. cite:[Sandkuhl_Stirna_Persson_Wi√üotzki_2014]

*Usability*

_The ease with which the enterprise model can be used for its intended purpose._ 

The models were designed to be useful in analysing business processes.
It has shown to be useful in identifying a potential innovation, namely the Stock Tracker service.
It also covers potential threats that stakeholders / intended users should be aware of. 
Its design is straightforward, and the Trikom committee members should be able to use it.
The proposed service innovation should have a clear impact on the existing business process and it covers the required changes to achieve so.


*Understanding*

_The ease with which the concepts and structures in the enterprise model can be understood by the stakeholders._



*Completeness*

_The degree to which all relevant facts of the problem domain are included in the enterprise model._


*Correctness*

_How well the enterprise model conforms to the rules of the modeling technique._


*Flexibility*

_The ease with which the enterprise model can cope with changes in the modeling domain._


*Integration*

_The degree of consistency between the different sub-models (enterprise perspectives) that constitute the enterprise model._


*Simplicity*

_The degree of minimal use of modeling constructs for presenting
knowledge in the enterprise model._

// | Assess if your model meets its purpose. You can use any of the methods we 
// learned for evaluating models or any other means. (Hint . connect your 
// model to its purposes and ask if it meets the purpose

// | How did you evaluate yur model . what evaluations methods (from theory) did 
// you consider? Justify your choice of evaluation method(s). Describe how you 
// evaluate your model, using the model and include screen shots of the relevant 
// parts of the model. Describe why you think your model is good and meets the 
// purpose (or not).
