=== Business and Value Modeling

So far, it has been discussed how the proposed service would influence the users.
The next chapter discusses how value is created from a business perspective.
To prevent any ambiguity:
The new service benefits both Trikom committee members, Online as an organization, and Kiosken users on a regular basis.
These are critical distinctions to make.

==== Business Model Canvas

Business modeling is frequently concerned with increasing income.
Because Online is a non-profit organization, presenting the immediate financial advantages of revenue streams was challenging, but other values are provided. 
There are various business models that might be used.

Because it is aimed at startups cite:[skowronLeanCanvasVs], a _Lean Business Canvas_, a version of the business model canvas, was not chosen.
The lean business canvas includes a metric termed _unfair advantage,_ which tries to differentiate the company from competitors.
This is not suitable for the provided scenario in this report, as the suggested service of the business model should be the focal point.

The _Value Proposition Model_ is another alternative.
This approach is rather straightforward, focusing on value propositions and how they relate to the customer.

My model's goal is to investigate how innovation provides value for both customers and the business overall.
I decided to use the _Business Model Canvas_ to do this.
This model incorporates essential interactions with customers as well as how key partners, such as Dotkom, bring value to the service. 

*Key Partners*

The crucial partners are those who will help us bring the service to life and make the business model function.
These are for the Stock Tracker service:

_Software Developer_ +
They are the ones who are in charge of developing and delivering the service.
They play an important role in ensuring that the service operates properly at all times.

_Trikom Member_ +
They are the ones who will use the service after it is completed.
They will be able to influence whether or not the service is good.
It is critical that they provide timely feedback so that Dotkom can make required modifications to the service.

_Partner at stores_ +
Trikom has various partners in local stores who help them achieve lower prices on Kiosken items.
They frequently plan their shopping with those partners ahead of time to ensure a seamless procedure.
As the service results in more regular visits, a robust interaction with these partners is critical. 

*Key Activities*

The key activities are those that occur in Kiosken and are related to the proposed service.
There is no need for the service if there are no sales because there is no need for restocking.
The other process, restock planning, determines how a restock will be carried out.
This is significant since it makes extensive use of the service's customized shopping list. 


*Key Resources*

These are the most significant assets necessary for the business model to function properly.
There is no need for the service if there are no customers.
The service will not be created until Dotkom developers are available.
For the service to function properly it needs access to the stock data. Without this access it will not be able to notify when certain items are running out. 


*Value Propositions*

The propositions describe the value that the invention provides.
The values range from reduced workload to reduced uncertainty for consumers.

_Workload Reduction_ +
Because the Stock Tracker service seeks to eliminate some manual tasks, the total workload is expected to be greatly reduced.
It's great not to have to count stuff or make a shopping list.
Furthermore, because the service allows for more frequent restocking in lower amounts, the total effort is decreased. 

_Less uncertainty_ +
The service includes notifications for all Online members, who are also the most frequent customers.
This, along with more frequent restocking, allows customers to readily determine whether or not Kiosken is stocked.
If an item is out of stock, it is realistic to anticipate it to be available in a reasonable length of time. 

*Customer Relationships*

The relationships describe how the service interacts with its users.
Trikom needs to interact with the Stock Tracker.
When a restock is done, they must update the current stock with the most recent numbers.
Because the interraction part of the service is intended solely for those members, their preferences are critical to enhancements and usage. 


*Channels*

This section covers the channels that the Stock Tracker service will use to reach out to clients.
The service is automated, and it will communicate via Slack.
It is worth noting that the service will operate through two channels.
One for messaging to Trikom, and another for public messages. 


*Customer Segments*

In terms of the value generated, customers are identified as the most significant.
The innovation is primarily intended to benefit Trikom committee members, but regular customers are also included because they are heavily impacted. 


*Cost Structure*

The cost structure specifies which activities the business must be willing to dedicate resources to in order for the business model to succeed.
As a non-profit organization run entirely by volunteers, Online will not have to budget for the service.
However, in order for the model to be successful, time and effort must be invested.
Once established and in use, the service must be maintained and maybe enhanced until it is excellent.
Allocating additional time for the initial restocks with the new service may also be advisable, since the service may fail and unforeseen events occur. 


*Revenue Streams*

The revenue streams are not monetary, as stated in the introduction.
However, revenue may be measured in terms of less time spent on monotonous and repetitive tasks.
There is a significant reduction in the amount of time spent on such duties, which might inspire committee members.
Furthermore, the time saved may be used to benefit other social contexts, such as online members.
Another revenue may be the increased positive reputation for Online.
Kiosken's good reputation may lead to increased sales and consequently pleased customers and members.
