=== Business and Value Modeling

So far, it has been discussed how the proposed service would influence the users.
The next chapter discusses how value is created from a business perspective.
To prevent any ambiguity:
The new service benefits both Trikom committee members, Online as an organization, and Kiosken users on a regular basis.
These are critical distinctions to make.

==== Business Model Canvas

Business modeling is frequently concerned with increasing income.
Because Online is a non-profit organization, presenting the immediate financial advantages of revenue streams was challenging, but other values are provided. 
There are various business models that might be used.

Because it is aimed at startups cite:[skowronLeanCanvasVs], a _Lean Business Canvas_, a version of the business model canvas, was not chosen.
The lean business canvas includes a metric termed _unfair advantage,_ which tries to differentiate the company from competitors.
This is not suitable for the provided scenario in this report, as the suggested service of the business model should be the focal point.

The _Value Proposition Model_ is another alternative.
This approach is rather straightforward, focusing on value propositions and how they relate to the customer.

My model's goal is to investigate how innovation provides value for both customers and the business overall.
I decided to use the _Business Model Canvas_ to do this.
This model incorporates essential interactions with customers as well as how key partners, such as Dotkom, bring value to the service. 

*Value Propositions*

The propositions describe the value that the invention provides.
The values range from reduced workload to reduced uncertainty for consumers.

_Workload Reduction_ +
Because the Stock Tracker service seeks to eliminate some manual tasks, the total workload is expected to be greatly reduced.
It's great not to have to count stuff or make a shopping list.
Furthermore, because the service allows for more frequent restocking in lower amounts, the total effort is decreased. 

_Less uncertainty_ +
The service includes notifications for all Online members, who are also the most frequent customers.
This, along with more frequent restocking, allows customers to readily determine whether or not Kiosken is stocked.
If an item is out of stock, it is realistic to anticipate it to be available in a reasonable length of time. 


*Customer Segments*

In terms of the value generated, customers are identified as the most significant.
The innovation is primarily intended to benefit Trikom committee members, but regular customers are also included because they are heavily impacted. 


*Channels*

This section covers the channels that the Stock Tracker service will use to reach out to clients.
The service is automated, and it will communicate via Slack.
It is worth noting that the service will operate through two channels.
One for messaging to Trikom, and another for public messages.
