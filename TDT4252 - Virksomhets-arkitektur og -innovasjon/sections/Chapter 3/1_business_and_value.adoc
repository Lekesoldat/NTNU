=== Business and Value Modeling

So far, it has been discussed how the proposed service would influence the users.
The next chapter discusses how value is created from a business perspective.
To prevent any ambiguity:
The new service benefits both Trikom committee members, Online as an organization, and Kiosken users on a regular basis.
These are critical distinctions to make.

==== Business Model Canvas

Business modeling is frequently concerned with increasing income.
Because Online is a non-profit organization, presenting the immediate financial advantages of revenue streams was challenging, but other values are provided. 
There are various business models that might be used.

Because it is aimed at startups cite:[skowronLeanCanvasVs], a _Lean Business Canvas_, a version of the business model canvas, was not chosen.
The lean business canvas includes a metric termed _unfair advantage,_ which tries to differentiate the company from competitors.
This is not suitable for the provided scenario in this report, as the suggested service of the business model should be the focal point.

The _Value Proposition Model_ is another alternative.
This approach is rather straightforward, focusing on value propositions and how they relate to the customer.

My model's goal is to investigate how innovation provides value for both customers and the business overall.
I decided to use the _Business Model Canvas_ to do this.
This model incorporates essential interactions with customers as well as how key partners, such as Dotkom, bring value to the service.
