<h2 id="_enterprise_modeling">1. Enterprise Modeling</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_case_description">1.1. Case Description</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The selected case and its focus will be on the student association, Online [<a href="#LinjeforeningenOnline">1</a>].
Online is one of the most significant student associations at NTNU, with nearly a thousand active members.
Hierarchically, Online is built up by several committees, some larger than others.
Out of the nearly thousand active members, at least 160 of them are committee members powering Online.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The case will specifically target a process in one of the committees - Trikom [<a href="#trikom">2</a>].
Trikom is the committee for well-being.
The committee is in charge of the kiosk at Online&#8217;s office and organizes smaller social events, to mention some.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The case itself regards the kiosk, hereafter called 'Kiosken.'
Kiosken has a relatively broad selection of both snacks and soft drinks.
Students purchase these items through an internal economy connected to the student ID cards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Students would like to have all items available at all times.
However, through some research and personal experiences, it is clear that the availability of items is unpredictable.
For example, students experience empty shelves of their favorite snacks for an extensive period, and there is no
way of knowing when a restock happens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As for the committee members of Trikom, there are several annoyances as well.
The restocking process appears to be quite comprehensive and unpredictable.
'When will it happen,' 'who is responsible,' and 'who does what' are frequently asked questions.
Further, it appears to be much micromanagement which in an ideal world would not exist.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a member of Online, I am a frequent user of Kiosken.
The problems mentioned above significantly impact me as a regular customer.
My biggest motivation for the presented case is to figure out how to streamline the restocking process and thus provide better and more predictable availability of the goods in Kiosken.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By utilizing an enterprise model, from Trikom&#8217;s perspective, one can hopefully understand the underlying processes of the restocking and identify innovations to streamline those.</p>
</div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="processes">1.2. Case Processes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The overall process of keeping Kiosken restocked, is a combination of several smaller processes.
The following paragraphs are meant to give a brief introduction to these.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The Process of Identifying a Need For a Restock</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As of now, there is no concrete process of identifying the need for a restock.
The need is identified by regular users reporting a lack of items, or by Trikom members checking manually.
Even though regular users report few items, or they are identified as out of stock by Trikom themselves, the actually restock may not happen immediately.
It is a common practice to wait for Kiosken to be almost out of stock of all items before a restock is even planned.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The Process of Planning a Restock</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a restock is about to happen, a shopping list is to be made.
All items in Kiosken is counted, and how much of each should be bought is calculated.
A part of the planning is also to check the dates of existing items, as well as checking the storage room for space for the new ones.
When the storage is checked, and the shopping list is made, the Trikom members have to coordinate the shopping trip.
Assigning different tasks to different Trikom members, varying from driving and shopping, to carrying and filling shelves and storage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The Process of Restocking</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A car has to be rented and several members have to perform the actual shopping.
The shopping is done at a partner.
When the shopping is finished, either the same members as those who shopped, or others, have to carry all the new items into the storage unit and restock the shelves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the entire restocking process is initiated, it is time consuming and involves many parts.
Ideally certain sub processes can be be improved or even eliminated by innovation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="purpose">1.3. Purpose</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most business constantly aim to increase their profit.
However, the operation of Kiosken is a zero-profit project for Online.
Better availability will not generate more revenue, but the user satisfaction will greatly increase, which is in line with Trikoms goals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This model should serve as a beneficial overview of the key processes of the restocking of Kiosken.
The current models give a precise overview of the relevant parts of the case AS IS.
No unnecessary information will surface, and the models have a logical easy-to-follow structure.
By getting a overview of all sub process, actors and goaals, Trikom could identify steps and processes that could be greatly improved.
Through this, innovation can be applied, and Trikom optimize their processes, thus resulting in a better service for Onlines members.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_goals">1.3.1. Goals</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many reasons to create enterprise models.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
A model is a generalized representation of a piece of reality, with only relevant real‐world properties taken into account during modeling. [<a href="#Sandkuhl_Stirna_Persson_Wißotzki_2014">6</a>]
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Sandkuhl et al.
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, models help to represent and understand how an enterprise works.
The model represent a relevant piece of reality, aiming to give greater insight into information, functions, behaviour and further on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, the overall goal of the model is to be <strong>beneficial to analyze the business processes</strong>.
Some sub goals will be to <strong>identify possible innovation(s)</strong> and <strong>identify potential threats to reaching the business goals</strong>.
Further, a goal is to <strong>visualize</strong> the business processes to get a hands-on look at what is actually going on.
Related to the vizualization-goal, a precise sub goal will be to <strong>create the model in such a way that the committe members of Trikom is able to utilize it</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_success_criteria">1.3.2. Success criteria</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several ways to evaluate models.
For instance, Sandkuhl et al. [<a href="#Sandkuhl_Stirna_Persson_Wißotzki_2014">6</a>] mentions competency questions and quality criteria. One can also apply a framework such as SEQUAL.
Common to all, is how well the model fulfills the goals.
For this case I will use the <strong>quality criteria</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many possible quality criteria one can apply.
The criterias fitting the case the best are the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Usability</strong> (Goal 1): The ease with which the enterprise model can be used for its intended
purpose [<a href="#Sandkuhl_Stirna_Persson_Wißotzki_2014">6</a>].</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The model should be able to identify possible innovation(s).
To achieve such, it has to include enough information with relevant details and perspectives/views. The goal is not met if the model is designed in a way that does not provide sufficient perspectives to analyze for possible innovation(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Trikom is unable to identify potential risks, the model is not adequate enough.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Understanding</strong> (Goal 2): The ease with which the concepts and structures in the enterprise
model can be understood by the stakeholders [<a href="#Sandkuhl_Stirna_Persson_Wißotzki_2014">6</a>].</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The models have to be precise and understandable. Only the relevant information should be provided, and it should be in such a way that the Trikom committee members can make use of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The criteria is not met if the model leads to uncertainties or wrong conclusions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_model_design">1.4. Model Design</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The enterprise models presented are mostly concerned with the business process.
By concentrating on the business process, one may see both the important procedures and the individuals involved.
The goals are also significant since they serve as the reason why the tasks are carried out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To begin developing the models, I concentrated on the processes.
It was critical to have a thorough grasp of how a Kiosken operates.
When the processes with it&#8217;s sub processes was modeled, I focused on the goals.
To begin, I had some rough thoughts about the goals, but when the processes was clear, the goals were concretized and split into subgoals.
Once the processes were identified, the actors manifested themselves intuitively.
To avoid extraneous information, the models incorporate just relevant actors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The enterprise model was created using a top-down method.
The goals are provided first, followed by the procedures and the essential actors.
The model&#8217;s user is supposed to first comprehend the goals, then what is currently happening and what may be improved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both 4EM and ArchiMate employ comparable perspectives in this case.
The perspectives chosen were the most appropriate for the model and situation.
Because we were only going to use one modeling language for the report, having similar models aided us in deciding on a language.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_modeling_tools">1.7. Modeling Tools</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>4EM has been chosen as the language to use moving forward.
The parts that follow provide some reflections and reasons behind this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>4EM</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I first started modeling in 4EM, I rapidly realized how much the language has to offer.
4EM was simple to use, and I enjoyed how everything was structured.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In contrast to ArchiMate, I quickly learned how to use 4EM because it was comparable to prior modeling languages I had used.
The use of information sets fit my case perfectly, and the ability to compose and decompose processes was ideal.
I utilized a program I was familiar with, <a href="https://draw.io">draw.io</a>, and altogether, modeling with 4EM was a positive experience.
Its approach to process management was ideal for my situation, and when paired with a nice user experience, it quickly became my preferred language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I didn&#8217;t have the most complex case, but I could imagine 4EM being a bit restricting with anything more sophisticated.
Because the language has a somewhat rigid structure, I suppose it would be difficult to utilize in a situation including multiple processes, actors, and other notions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>ArchiMate</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I started modeling in 4EM, thus ArchiMate was first perplexing to me.
The concepts and their names were difficult to translate, but I eventually got the hang of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I tried out the Archi Modeling Tool and had mixed thoughts about it.
It was excellent to guarantee there were no technical faults, but I encountered several unexpected errors as well as problems with the general usage.
The irritation associated with this may have influenced the conclusion of the preferred language, but I continue to feel 4EM was the greatest decision.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my perspective, 4EM excels in the process modeling, but ArchiMate is overall decent in all areas.
Archimate&#8217;s layers provide an advantage in that they indicate how processes are carried out and goals are attained from the business layer to the technology layer in a top-down approach.
Because my case was fairly process-oriented, I found ArchiMate to be a little weak, particularly in terms of the information shared between the processes.
4EM shines when it comes to showing how different views relate to eachother.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because the models will be utilized by Trikoms members who may be unfamiliar with modeling languages, it is critical that what is provided is intelligible and does not cause misunderstanding.
ArchiMate, with its diverse variety of components and levels, may be harder to grasp for those unfamiliar.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_using_the_model">1.8. Using the Model</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because I&#8217;ve decided to go with 4EM, I&#8217;ll be referring to these models from now on.
As mentioned in <a href="#purpose">Section 1.3</a>, the model should serve as '<strong>a beneficial overview of the key processes of the restocking of Kiosken</strong>.'</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Initially, the model is intended to be used to discover better solutions and potential improvements for the restocking process.
However, it should not be overlooked that the model can be valuable for new members of the committee as well.
By default, the committees' methods are introduced verbally, and most people learn by doing.
Having something solid will ensure that everyone receives the same information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By putting the <a href="#em_goals">goals</a> in print, all committee members will have a common foundation.
This perspective of view can spark debate and issue solutions.
It may be simpler to make choices and judgments if the goals are broken down into smaller sub-goals.
The goal model highlights important weaknesses, opportunities and obstacles.
Having them displayed aids in overall comprehension and ensures that potentially key events are not overlooked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All essential actors and resources are shown in the <a href="#em_actor">Actors and Resources model</a>.
By illustrating the relationships between them, as well as how they are linked to the processes in the enterprise model, ambiguity about how duties are divided and who performs what is avoided.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The subprocesses depicted in the <a href="#em_process">Business Process View</a> allow model users to gain a clear picture of what is going on.
This is where the potential for innovation are uncovered, and it is evident which stages could be shortened.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_open_service_innovation_and_service_design">2. Open Service Innovation and Service Design</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As previously stated, Kiosken issues with product availability.
Members of Online have additional possibilities outside Kiosken, although they are at competitive student associations.
To keep students pleased and maintain a good reputation, Online and Trikom must be better in terms of item availability.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_method">2.1. Method</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Double Diamond Design approach [<a href="#doubleDiamond">5</a>]  was utilized to perform service innovation in an attempt to overcome the previously identified challenge.
The approach, which is similar to the more generic Open Innovation process, comprises four separate phases.
The relevant tools and methods provided by the Double Diamond Design process are detailed in the following paragraphs.
In particular, the phases <em>discover</em>, <em>define</em>, and <em>develop</em> will be covered.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_discover">2.1.1. Discover</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the <em>discover</em>-phase, one creates an understanding of the issues in the enterprise [<a href="#DoubleDiamondDesign2021">3</a>].
We will look into various service innovations that can hopefully fix these issues later.
As stated in the introduction, there are some issues with the restocking process.
The following aspects can be improved:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The item&#8217;s availability must be manually confirmed.
This is normally done at random by both committee members and ordinary Online members.
There is no set procedure for dealing with items that are out of stock, other than sending an email to Trikom or addressing it to a committee member.
When such a mail is sent, or the message passed on, no more information surfaces until the kiosk is restocked.
It is unknown when it will be completed or even if the notice is received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trikom must prepare ahead of time in order to carry out a restock.
First and foremost, all items in Kiosken&#8217;s shelves must be counted and date verified.
The items in storage must then be counted and the dates must be confirmed.
A shopping list must be created once the current supply is counted.
The quantity of each item required must be estimated depending on both popularity and storage availability.
A shopping session requires a lot of repetitive and manual labor.
There is no computer aid, therefore it is time-consuming and prone to human mistake.
In the worst-case scenario, purchasing too much of an item may result in it going bad and needing to be thrown out prior to sale owing to a lack of storage capacity.
This is not beneficial for the economy as a non-profit kiosk.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_define">2.1.2. Define</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two issues were discovered during the <em>discover</em>-phase.
The first is the manual labor of checking item availability and registering a restocking request.
The other is the time-consuming and human-error-prone procedure of organizing a shopping trip.
As the identified problems are experienced close to first hand, a few possible improvements has been thought of.
The idea is to implement a new digital service into the custom made Kiosk-app called Nibble4 [<a href="#Nibble4">4</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The service is designed to maintain track of item stock at all times and alert Trikom when it is time to restock.
Trikom will resupply more often, but in lower quantities.
Shopping trips will be shorter, and transporting and arranging items in storage and shelves will be easier.
Naturally, the availability of things will improve, as will consumer happiness.</p>

<p>Trikom members update the current stock counts while restocking Kiosken.
As time passes and items sell, the service will tell Trikom that a restock is imminent.
Along with the message, a completed shopping list is sent, and there will be no need for extensive item counting.
Because Online&#8217;s members are frequent Slack users, the service will also send a message via Slack, letting everyone know when a restock is recommended and when it is accomplished.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to their comparable origins, the suggested solution should be able to tackle both of the identified problems.
The service attempts to lessen the degree of uncertainty surrounding item availability while also eliminating human labor associated with item counting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dotkom, another committee in Online, will be utilized in the development of the innovation.
They are unrelated to Trikom&#8217;s processes, but the committee is in charge of technology solutions for all of Online&#8217;s committees.
The presented solutions does not need a large rearrangement of the restocking process, but it will have a significant impact.
The service will be referred to as the 'Stock Tracker' service from now on, and one sees that in <a href="#em_process">Figure 2</a>, the <em>Stock Tracker</em> service will replace the first business process and parts of the second.</p>

<p>The service can be created with limited cooperation from Trikom&#8217;s members.
Other than to the Dotkom developers, how the service is implemented is unimportant as long as the end result is as desired.
Dotkom&#8217;s sole involvement and contribution is required for the design of the notice and shopping list.
Despite the fact that the service is customised in a way that is unique to Kiosken and Nibble4, the innovation is open.
All code is open-source, and innovative ideas are gathered outside of the company&#8217;s walls.
The service will be created in-house, but with the assistance of existing external libraries.
Many of Dotkom&#8217;s services are cloud-based, however Nibble4 with the new service is run on a local server in Kiosken.</p>

<p>The Stock Creation Service will be displayed from the perspective of a Trikom member.
This is an actor who will be directly impacted by the innovation.
Regular consumers at Kiosken will be impacted indirectly since item availability will be more consistent.
Furthermore, clients may have a reduced wait time for a resupply.
Even though the innovation benefits the customers, the focis lies on the Trikom members as the goal is to streamline their workflow.
Customers' benefits are in-direct consequences of the invention, which has a direct impact on Trikoms members and their workflow.
As a result, only customer journeys from the perspective of Trikom members will be offered.</p>

The red borders emphasize the significance of the new service.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The notifications are the most visible difference for regular customers.
They are now notified when a restock is planned as well as when it is finished.
This may be seen at the <em>front of the stage</em>-part of the blueprint.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The true strength of the new service may be seen at the <em>back of the stage</em> and in the <em>support procedures and systems</em>.
The tailored shopping list allows committee members to notify refill plans while also saving substantial time spent on creating the list.
They may also notify customers when the restock is finished and update the Supply Tracker service with the new stock.</p>
