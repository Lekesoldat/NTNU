<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_case_description">1.1. Case Description</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The selected case and its focus will be on the student association, Online [<a href="#LinjeforeningenOnline">3</a>].
Online is one of the most significant student associations at NTNU, with nearly a thousand active members.
Hierarchically, Online is built up by several committees, some larger than others.
Out of the nearly thousand active members, at least 160 of them are committee members powering Online.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The case will specifically target a process in one of the committees - Trikom [<a href="#trikom">2</a>].
Trikom is the committee for well-being.
The committee is in charge of the kiosk at Online&#8217;s office and organizes smaller social events, to mention some.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The case itself regards the kiosk, hereafter called 'Kiosken.'
Kiosken has a relatively broad selection of both snacks and soft drinks.
Students purchase these items through an internal economy connected to the student ID cards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Students would like to have all items available at all times.
However, through some research and personal experiences, it is clear that the availability of items is unpredictable.
For example, students experience empty shelves of their favorite snacks for an extensive period, and there is no
way of knowing when a restock happens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As for the committee members of Trikom, there are several annoyances as well.
The restocking process appears to be quite comprehensive and unpredictable.
'When will it happen,' 'who is responsible,' and 'who does what' are frequently asked questions.
Further, it appears to be much micromanagement which in an ideal world would not exist.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a member of Online, I am a frequent user of Kiosken.
The problems mentioned above significantly impact me as a regular customer.
My biggest motivation for the presented case is to figure out how to streamline the restocking process and thus provide better and more predictable availability of the items in Kiosken.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By utilizing an enterprise model, from Trikom&#8217;s perspective, one can hopefully understand the underlying processes of the restocking and identify innovations to streamline those.</p>
</div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="processes">1.2. Case Processes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The overall process of keeping Kiosken restocked, is a combination of several smaller processes.
The following paragraphs are meant to give a brief introduction to these.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The Process of Identifying a Need for a Restock</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As of now, there is no concrete process of identifying the need for a restock.
The need is identified by regular users reporting a lack of items, or by Trikom members checking manually.
Even though regular users report few items, or they are identified as out of stock by Trikom themselves, the actually restock may not happen immediately.
It is a common practice to wait for Kiosken to be almost out of all items before a restock is even planned.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The Process of Planning a Restock</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a restock is about to happen, a shopping list is to be made.
All items in Kiosken is counted, and how much of each should be bought is calculated.
A part of the planning is also to check the dates of existing items, as well as checking the storage room for space for the new ones.
When the storage is checked, and the shopping list is made, the Trikom members have to coordinate the shopping trip.
Assigning different tasks to different Trikom members, varying from driving and shopping, to carrying and filling shelves and storage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The Process of Restocking</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A car has to be rented and several members have to perform the actual shopping.
The shopping is done at certain grocery stores with an agreement benefiting both parts.
When the shopping is finished, either the same members as those who shopped, or others, have to carry all the new items into the storage unit and restock the shelves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the entire restocking process is initiated, it is time consuming and involves many parts.
Ideally certain sub-processes can be be improved or even eliminated by innovation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="purpose">1.3. Purpose</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most business constantly aim to increase their profit.
However, the operation of Kiosken is a zero-profit project for Online.
Better availability will not generate more revenue, but the user satisfaction will greatly increase, which is in line with Trikoms goals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This model should serve as a beneficial overview of the key processes of the restocking of Kiosken.
No unnecessary information will surface, and the models have a logical easy-to-follow structure.
By getting an overview of all sub process, actors and goals, Trikom could identify steps and processes that could be greatly improved.
Through this, innovation can be applied, and Trikom optimize their processes, thus resulting in a better service for Onlines members.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="goals">1.3.1. Goals</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many reasons to create enterprise models.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
A model is a generalized representation of a piece of reality, with only relevant real‐world properties taken into account during modeling. [<a href="#Sandkuhl_Stirna_Persson_Wißotzki_2014">9</a>]
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Sandkuhl et al.
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, models help to represent and understand how an enterprise works.
The model represent a relevant piece of reality, aiming to give greater insight into information, functions, behaviour and further on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, the overall goal of the model is to be <strong><em>beneficial to analyze the business processes</em></strong>.
Some sub-goals will be to <strong>identify possible innovation(s)</strong> and <strong>identify potential threats to reaching the business goals</strong>.
Further, a goal is to <strong><em>visualize</em></strong> the business processes to get a hands-on look at what is actually going on.
Related to the vizualization-goal, a precise sub-goal will be to <strong>create the model in such a way that the committe members of Trikom is able to utilize it</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="success_criteria">1.3.2. Success criteria</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several ways to evaluate models.
For instance, Sandkuhl et al. [<a href="#Sandkuhl_Stirna_Persson_Wißotzki_2014">9</a>] mentions competency questions and quality criteria. One can also apply a framework such as SEQUAL.
Common to all, is to evaluate how well the model fulfills the defined goals.
For this case I will use the <strong>quality criteria</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many possible quality criteria one can apply.
The criterias fitting the case the best are the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Usability</strong> (Goal 1): The ease with which the enterprise model can be used for its intended
purpose [<a href="#Sandkuhl_Stirna_Persson_Wißotzki_2014">9</a>].</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The model should be able to identify possible innovation(s).
To achieve such, it has to include enough information with relevant details and perspectives/views. The goal is not met if the model is designed in a way that does not provide sufficient perspectives to analyze for possible innovation(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Trikom is unable to identify potential risks, the model is not adequate enough.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Understanding</strong> (Goal 2): The ease with which the concepts and structures in the enterprise
model can be understood by the stakeholders [<a href="#Sandkuhl_Stirna_Persson_Wißotzki_2014">9</a>].</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The models have to be precise and understandable. Only the relevant information should be provided, and it should be in such a way that the Trikom committee members can make use of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The criteria is not met if the model leads to uncertainties and confusion, i.e regarding processes or involved actors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="model_design">1.4. Model Design</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The enterprise models presented are mostly concerned with the business process.
By concentrating on the business process, one may see both the important procedures and the individuals involved.
The goals are also significant since they serve as the reason why the tasks are carried out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The enterprise model was created using a top-down method.
The goals are provided first, followed by the processes and the essential actors.
The model&#8217;s user is supposed to first comprehend the goals, then what is currently happening and what may be improved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To begin developing the models, I concentrated on the goals.
Once I had an outline of the goals, i focused on the processes with it&#8217;s sub-processes.
When the processes was finished, I had a few new ideas regarding how I could concretize the goals, and I did so by creating sub-goals and detailing a bit more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the processes were identified, the actors manifested themselves intuitively.
To avoid extraneous information, the models incorporate just relevant actors.
One may question why the actors are included when there is only one actor performing the actual tasks in the first models.
The reason is to acknowledge the existence of Dotkom, as they bring the opportunity to create the proposed service.
In the latter models, the actors include the very important developers both creating and maintaining the service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both 4EM and ArchiMate employ comparable perspectives in this case.
The perspectives chosen were the most appropriate for the model and situation.
Because we were only going to use one modeling language for the report, having similar models aided me in deciding on a language.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Trikom&#8217;s overarching goal is to 'Increase customer satisfaction.'
This goal is difficult to measure, and it may never be considered as <em>reached</em> simply because.
However, having this as the main goal makes a it easier to create supporting and achievable sub-goals.
The sub-goals to achieve this is given as 'Increasing the variety of items in stock', or by 'increasing the availability of items.'
The inefficient restocking process, which is the key bottleneck of item supply, must be streamlined.
It is the increased availability-part that will be the focus of this report.
Goals for streamlining the restocking process include reducing the number of steps in the restocking and automating the detection of need.
Opportunities as well as threats are addressed.
Further, possible constraints are highlighted.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_modeling_tools">1.6. Modeling Tools</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>4EM has been chosen as the language to use moving forward.
The parts that follow provide some reflections and reasons behind this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>4EM</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I first started modeling in 4EM, I rapidly realized how much the language has to offer.
4EM was simple to use, and I enjoyed how everything was structured.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In contrast to ArchiMate, I quickly learned how to use 4EM because it was comparable to prior modeling languages I had used.
The use of information sets fit my case perfectly, and the ability to compose and decompose processes was ideal.
I utilized a program I was familiar with, <a href="https://draw.io">draw.io</a>, and altogether, modeling with 4EM was a positive experience.
Its approach to process management was ideal for my situation, and when paired with a nice user experience, it quickly became my preferred language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I didn&#8217;t have the most complex case, but I could imagine 4EM being a bit restricting with anything more sophisticated.
Because the language has a somewhat rigid structure, I suppose it would be difficult to utilize in a situation including multiple processes, actors, and other notions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>ArchiMate</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I started modeling in 4EM, thus ArchiMate was first perplexing to me.
The concepts and their names were difficult to translate, but I eventually got the hang of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I tried the Archi Modeling Tool and had mixed thoughts about it.
It was excellent to guarantee there were no technical faults, but I encountered several unexpected errors as well as problems with the general usage.
The frustration associated with this may have influenced the conclusion of the preferred language, but I still feel 4EM was the greatest decision.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my perspective, 4EM excels in the process modeling, but ArchiMate is overall decent in all areas.
Archimate&#8217;s layers provide an advantage in that they indicate how processes are carried out and goals are attained from the business layer to the technology layer in a top-down approach.
Because my case was fairly process-oriented, I found ArchiMate to be a little weak, particularly in terms of the information shared between the processes.
4EM shines when it comes to showing how different views relate to eachother.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because the models will be utilized by Trikoms members who may be unfamiliar with modeling languages, it is critical that what is provided is intelligible and does not cause misunderstanding.
ArchiMate, with its diverse variety of components and levels, may be harder to grasp for those unfamiliar.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_using_the_model">1.7. Using the Model</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because I&#8217;ve decided to go with 4EM, I&#8217;ll be referring to these models from now on.
As mentioned in <a href="#purpose">Section 1.3</a>, the model should serve as <em>a beneficial overview of the key processes of the restocking of Kiosken</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Initially, the model is intended to be used to discover better solutions and potential improvements for the restocking process.
However, it should not be overlooked that the model can be valuable for new members of the committee as well.
By default, the committees' methods are introduced verbally, and most people learn by doing.
Having something solid will ensure that everyone receives the same information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By putting the <a href="#em_goals">goals</a> in print, all committee members will have a common foundation.
This perspective of view can spark debate and issue solutions.
It may also be simpler to make choices and judgments if the goals are broken down into smaller sub-goals.
The <a href="#em_goals">goal model</a> highlights important weaknesses, opportunities and obstacles.
Having them displayed aids in overall comprehension and ensures that potentially key events are not overlooked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All essential actors and resources are shown in the <a href="#em_actor">Actors and Resources Model</a>.
By illustrating the relationships between them, as well as how they are linked to the processes in the enterprise model, ambiguity about how duties are divided and who performs what is avoided.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sub-processes depicted in the <a href="#em_process">Business Process Model</a> allow model users to gain a clear picture of what is going on.
This is where the potential for innovation are uncovered, and it is evident which stages could be shortened.</p>

<h2 id="_open_service_innovation_and_service_design">2. Open Service Innovation and Service Design</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As previously stated, Kiosken issues with product availability.
Members of Online have additional alternatives outside Kiosken, although they are at competitive student associations.
To keep students pleased and maintain a good reputation, Online and Trikom must be better in terms of item availability.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_method">2.1. Method</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Double Diamond Design approach [<a href="#doubleDiamond">6</a>] was utilized to perform service innovation in an attempt to overcome the previously identified challenge.
The approach, which is similar to the more generic Open Innovation process, comprises four separate phases.
The relevant tools and methods provided by the Double Diamond Design process are detailed in the following paragraphs.
In particular, the phases <em>discover</em>, <em>define</em>, and <em>develop</em> will be covered.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="_discover" class="discrete">Discover</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the <em>discover</em>-phase, one creates an understanding of the issues in the enterprise [<a href="#DoubleDiamondDesign2021">4</a>].
We will look into a service innovation that can hopefully fix these issues later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As stated in the introduction, there are some issues with the restocking process.
The following aspects can be improved:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The item&#8217;s availability must be manually confirmed.
This is normally done at random by both committee members and ordinary Online members.
There is no set procedure for dealing with items that are out of stock, other than sending an email to Trikom or addressing it to a committee member.
When such a mail is sent, or the message passed on, no more information surfaces until the kiosk is restocked.
To the customer, when it will be completed or even if the notice is received is unknown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trikom must prepare ahead of time in order to carry out a restock.
First and foremost, all items in Kiosken&#8217;s shelves must be counted and date verified.
The items in storage also has to be counted and the dates verified.
A shopping list must be created once the current supply is counted.
The quantity of each item required must be estimated depending on both popularity and storage availability.
A shopping session requires a lot of repetitive and manual labor.
There is no computer aid, therefore it is time-consuming and prone to human mistake.
In the worst-case scenario, purchasing too much of an item may result in it going bad and needing to be thrown out prior to sale owing to a lack of storage capacity.
This is not beneficial for the economy as a non-profit kiosk.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4 id="_define" class="discrete">Define</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two issues were discovered during the <em>discover</em>-phase.
The first is the manual labor of checking item availability and registering a restocking request.
The other is the time-consuming and human-error-prone procedure of organizing a shopping trip.
As the identified problems are experienced close to first hand, a few possible improvements has been thought of.
The idea is to implement a new <em>digital service</em> into the custom made kiosk-app called Nibble [<a href="#Nibble4">5</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The service is designed to maintain track of item stock at all times and alert Trikom when it is time to restock.
Trikom will resupply more often, but in lower quantities.
Shopping trips will be shorter, and transporting and arranging items in storage and shelves will be easier.
Naturally, the availability of things will improve, as will consumer happiness.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Trikom members update the current stock counts while restocking Kiosken.
As time passes and items sell, the service will tell Trikom that a restock is imminent.
Along with the message, a completed shopping list is sent, and there will be no need for extensive item counting.
Because Online&#8217;s members are frequent Slack users, the service will also send a message there, letting everyone know when a restock is recommended and when it is accomplished.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to their comparable origins, the suggested solution should be able to tackle both of the identified problems.
The service attempts to lessen the degree of uncertainty surrounding item availability while also eliminating human labor associated with item counting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dotkom, another committee in Online, will be utilized in the development of the innovation.
They are unrelated to Trikom&#8217;s processes, but the committee is in charge of technology solutions for all of Online&#8217;s committees.
The presented solutions does not need a large rearrangement of the restocking process, but it will have a significant impact.
The service will be referred to as the 'Stock Tracker' service from now on, and one sees that in <a href="#em_process">Figure 2</a>, the <em>Stock Tracker</em> service will replace the first business process and parts of the second.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Blueprint is provided later in the report, in its own section, to add to the develop phase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The service can be created with limited cooperation from Trikom&#8217;s members.
Other than to the Dotkom developers, how the service is implemented is unimportant as long as the end result is as desired.
As for the development phase, Trikom&#8217;s sole involvement and contribution is required for the design of the notice and shopping list.
Despite the fact that the service is customised in a way that is unique to Kiosken and Nibble, the innovation is open.
All code is open-source, and innovative ideas are gathered outside of the company&#8217;s walls.
The service will be created in-house, but with the assistance of existing external libraries.
Many of Dotkom&#8217;s services are cloud-based, however Nibble with the new service is run on a local server in Kiosken.</p>

<h3 id="_create_a_customer_journey">2.2. Create a Customer Journey</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Stock Tracker service will be displayed from the perspective of a Trikom member.
This is an actor who will be directly impacted by the innovation.
Regular consumers at Kiosken will be impacted indirectly since item availability will be more consistent.
Furthermore, clients may have a reduced wait time for a resupply.
Even though the innovation benefits the customers, the focus lies on the Trikom members as the goal is to streamline their workflow.
Customers' benefits are in-direct consequences of the innovation, which has a direct impact on Trikoms members and their workflow.
As a result, only customer journeys from the perspective of Trikom members will be offered.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="#before_innovation">Figure 9</a> shows the customer journey <em>before</em> the innovation.<br>
Before the actual restocking process begins, a Trikom committee member has to do a manual checkup on the current stock.
When a restock is determined to be necessary, the member must calculate how much of each item should be shopped.
A shopping list is created, and then Trikom has to figure out how to perform the shopping.
When the shopping is done, one has to finish the process with restocking the shelves and the storage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The important parts are those happening before and during the journey.
The discovered issues regard the manual check of the current stock and the manual counting and determination of a restock.
These parts are time consuming and very unpredictable for the customers of Kiosken.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most significant change occurs before the journey starts.
There is no longer a manual step in which committee members must decide whether or not to restock.
There is also no need to prepare a shopping list.
A tailored shopping list is generated, along with a notification informing Trikom that a restock is required.
The restocking goes as usual, however the customers will receive a notification telling them when Kiosken is restocked.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The true strength of the new service may be seen at the <em>back of the stage</em> and in the <em>support procedures and systems</em>.
The tailored shopping list allows committee members to notify restock plans while also saving substantial time spent on creating the list.
They may also notify customers when the restock is finished and update the Supply Tracker service with the new stock.</p>

<h3 id="_reflections">2.4. Reflections</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Online is a non-profit organization that prioritizes the well-being of its members.
The student association must be creative in order to receive financing from the institute, generate money to give back to members, and so on.
The revenue is assured as long as the members are pleased; but, keeping it that way is difficult.
There are several competing student organizations and associations vying for members.
To maintain Online&#8217;s long-term viability as a popular and preferred student organization, they must always be the best option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be innovative, it is not enough to just provide new services and retain existing members, - it is also about expanding the member base.
Through the Kiosken-innovation with the Stock Tracker service, Online and Trikom may have the finest kiosk at NTNU.
It is available to members outside of Online as well, and it is an excellent marketing tool for both the association and the field of study, Informatics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The models undoubtedly aid in providing an overview over ongoing processes, goals and those involved.
The customer journeys aid in providing an overview of the steps for the various actors engaged at particular phases.
Creating journeys before and after the innovation also provides valuable information into what changes and how it impacts users.
Enterprise models often focus on one point of view or generalized interactions, and as a complimentary service, such models help us grasp the many points of view more clearly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The user experience and service appeal are at the forefront of service design.
When compared to enterprise models that focus on higher-level insight into processes and services, service design provides excellent, comprehensive information and approaches giving insight into the customer&#8217;s needs.
I.e the blueprint clearly conveys a sense of practicality and worth to the enterprise.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_business_and_value_modeling">3.1. Business and Value Modeling</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far, it has been discussed how the proposed service would influence the users.
The next chapter discusses how value is created from a business perspective.
To prevent any ambiguity:
The new service benefits both Trikom committee members, Online as an organization, and Kiosken users on a regular basis.
These are critical distinctions to make.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_business_model_canvas">3.1.1. Business Model Canvas</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Business modeling is frequently concerned with increasing income.
Because Online is a non-profit organization, presenting the immediate financial advantages of revenue streams was challenging, but other values are provided.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are various business models that can be utilized.
Because it is aimed at startups [<a href="#skowronLeanCanvasVs">10</a>], a <em>Lean Business Canvas</em>, a version of the <em>Business Model Canvas</em>, was not chosen.
The lean business canvas includes a metric termed <em>unfair advantage,</em> which tries to differentiate the company from competitors.
This is not suitable for the provided scenario in this report, as the proposed service of the business model should be the focal point.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 12. Lean Business Canvas || Source: [<a href="#skowronLeanCanvasVs">10</a>]</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Value Proposition Model</em> is another alternative.
This approach is rather straightforward, focusing on value propositions and how they relate to the customer.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">

<div class="title">Figure 13. Value Proposition Canvas || <a href="https://jaantollander.github.io/SCI-C1000/value-proposition.html">Source</a></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My model&#8217;s goal is to investigate how innovation provides value for both customers and the business overall.
I decided to use the <em>Business Model Canvas</em> to do this.
This model incorporates essential interactions with customers as well as how key partners, such as Dotkom, bring value to the service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Key Partners</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key partners are those who will help bring the service to life and make the business model function.
These are for the Stock Tracker service:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Software Developer</em><br>
They are the ones who are in charge of developing and delivering the service.
They play an important role in ensuring that the service operates properly at all times.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Trikom Member</em><br>
They are the ones who will use the service after it is completed.
They will be able to influence whether or not the service is good.
It is critical that they provide timely feedback so that Dotkom can make required modifications to the service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Partner at stores</em><br>
Trikom has various partners in local stores who help them achieve lower prices on Kiosken items.
They frequently plan their shopping with those partners ahead of time to ensure a seamless procedure.
As the service results in more regular visits, a robust interaction with these partners is critical.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Key Activities</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key activities are those that occur in Kiosken and are related to the proposed service.
There is no need for the service if there are no sales because there is no need for restocking.
The other process, restock planning, determines how a restock will be carried out.
This is significant since it makes extensive use of the service&#8217;s tailored shopping list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Key Resources</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are the most significant assets necessary for the business model to function properly.
As mentioned, there is no need for the service if there are no customers.
The service will not be created until Dotkom developers are available.
For the service to function properly it needs access to the stock data.
Without this access it will not be able to notify when certain items are running out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Value Propositions</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The propositions describe the value that the invention provides.
The values range from reduced workload to reduced uncertainty for consumers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Workload Reduction</em><br>
Because the Stock Tracker service seeks to eliminate some manual tasks, the total workload is expected to be greatly reduced.
It&#8217;s great not to have to count items or make a shopping list.
Furthermore, because the service allows for more frequent restocking in lower amounts, the total effort is decreased.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Less uncertainty</em><br>
The service includes notifications for all Online members, who are also the most frequent customers.
This, along with more frequent restocking, allows customers to readily determine whether or not Kiosken is stocked.
If an item is out of stock, it is realistic to anticipate it to be available within a reasonable amount of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Customer Relationships</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The relationships describe how the service interacts with its users.
Trikom needs to interact with the Stock Tracker.
Because the interraction part of the service is intended solely for those members, their preferences are critical to enhancements and usage.
When a restock is done, they must update the current stock with the most recent numbers.
The service also initiates the entire restocking process with it&#8217;s notification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One can mention the regular customers as well.
Their loyalty to Kiosken will be strengthened if the service functions well and they are satisfied.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Channels</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section covers the channels that the Stock Tracker service will use to reach out to clients.
The service is automated, and it will communicate via Slack.
It is worth noting that the service will operate through two channels.
One for messaging to Trikom, and another for public messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Customer Segments</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In terms of the value generated, Trikom members are identified as the most significant.
The innovation is primarily intended to benefit these, but regular customers are also included because they are in-directly impacted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Cost Structure</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cost structure specifies which activities the business must be willing to dedicate resources to in order for the business model to succeed.
As a non-profit organization run entirely by volunteers, Online will not have to budget for the service.
However, in order for the model to be successful, time and effort must be invested.
Once established and in use, the service must be maintained and maybe enhanced until it is excellent.
Allocating additional time for the initial restocks with the new service may also be advisable, since the service may fail and unforeseen events occur.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Revenue Streams</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The revenue streams are not monetary, as stated in the introduction.
However, revenue may be measured in terms of less time spent on monotonous and repetitive tasks.
There is a significant reduction in the amount of time spent on such duties, which might inspire committee members.
The time saved may be used to benefit other social contexts.
Another revenue may be the increased positive reputation for Online.
Kiosken&#8217;s good reputation may lead to increased sales and consequently pleased customers and members.</p>

<p>The models will be redesigned in this section to complement the planned innovation.
Changes will be made to the 4EM-models.
The affected models are both the Actors and Resources Model and the Business Process Model.
Naturally this affects the Enterprise Model as well.
All notable changes in the models are highlighted with red borders (does not include constraints in Goal model).</p>

<h4 id="_the_changed_business_process_model">4.1.2. The Changed Business Process Model</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most significant change appears in this model.
The first process is totally eliminated, and the new process starts with the old process' output, namely <em>Information set 2 - Shopping list</em>.
In line with the goals defined in <a href="#em_goal">the Goal model</a>, the proposed service has streamlined certain parts of the restocking process.
Previously the shopping list was created manually, and the need for a restock uncovered in the same manual way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The notification,  _Information set 1, remains the same, however the way it is created is new.
This is not shown in the model, but described in this paragraph and previously.
The proposed service, the Stock Tracker, keeps track of the items in stock.
When a certain threshold is reached, it sends a notification to Trikom with a tailored shopping list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Slack-notice (<em>Information set 3</em>) is issued as a new element in <em>Process 1</em>.
This tells all of Online&#8217;s members that a restock is in the works.
As a result, the stock is more predictable, which motivates the goal of enhanced customer satisfaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A new information set is shown in <em>Process 2</em>.
This information set offers data about the current stock following the restock.
This data is added to the Stock Tracker to keep it up to date.
When this is accomplished, a notification is issued to all of Online&#8217;s members informing them that Kiosken&#8217;s items are once again available.</p>

<em>Enterprise Architecture</em> is a coherent whole of principles, methods, and models that are used in the design and realisation of an enterprise’s organisational structure, business processes, information systems and infrastructure [<a href="#Lankhorst_2017">8</a>].

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>correctness</em> of the model is evaluated good.</p>

<p><strong>Flexibility</strong></p>

<p><em>The ease with which the enterprise model can cope with changes in the modeling domain.</em></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Everything was created using <a href="https://draw.io">draw.io</a>.
Within the tool, the various sub-models are separated into their own tabs, making it simple to make modifications to only certain components.
As a consequence of the multiple sub-models being separate, the model is particularly adaptable and robust to dealing with changes within the domain.
Furthermore, because the model is not very complicated, the amount of work required to make necessary adjustments would be manageable.</p>

<p>The <em>flexibility</em> of the model is evaluated very good.</p>

<p><strong>Overall quality</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The model&#8217;s <em>overall quality</em> is rated as good, but there is there is space for improvement.
Someone more experienced  might use elements and aspects of 4EM that I am not familiar with, improving both understanding and accuracy.</p>

<h3 id="_reflections_2">5.2. Reflections</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I found the entire process to be rather challenging.
I haven&#8217;t been able to attend as many lectures as I had anticipated, but I&#8217;ve done my best to stay up-to-date through available learning materials and engagement with fellow students.
The main issue was connected to many big words and definitions I was not familiar with, and at some point had misunderstood.
Fortunately, this was mostly resolved during exercise lessons.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was a lot of fun brainstorming potential cases.
I took one case early on, and worked on it extensively until I concluded it just would not work.
Starting from scratch with a new case was definitely discouraging, but I had learned a lot and the process went much more smoothly the second time.
The largest advantage was taking detailed notes and describing the case thoroughly before modeling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m glad I have some prior experience with information systems and modeling.
Modeling my case was challenging using new tools, but it became fun after I got the hang of it and the many elements fell into place.
It took several modeling iterations until I was satisfied, and I am pleased with the outcome.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If I had to do it all over again, I would surely do certains things differently.
Before modeling, I would familiarize myself with both 4EM and ArchiMate so that I could have a better modeling experience.
Even while it was exciting at times, I spent a lot of time overwhelmed and confused by conventions and syntax.
I would also consider getting familiar with more of the frameworks for evaluation and enterprise architectures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All in all i think it was a challenging process, but I feel I have gotten rather good insights into business and enterprise modelling, as well as service innovation and the methods for analyzing them [<a href="#CourseEnterpriseArchitecture">1</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As I&#8217;ve never written anything longer than a few pages, writing such an extensive report was a great learning experience as well.</p>
