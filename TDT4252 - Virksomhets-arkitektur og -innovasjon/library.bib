  abstract = {Double Diamond is the name of a design process model popularized by the British Design Council in 2005, and adapted from the divergence-convergence model proposed in 1996 by Hungarian-American linguist B\'ela H. B\'an\'athy. The two diamonds represent a process of exploring an issue more widely or deeply (divergent thinking) and then taking focused action (convergent thinking). It suggests that the design process should have four phases: Discover: Understand the issue rather than merely assuming it. It involves speaking to and spending time with people who are affected by the issues. Define: The insight gathered from the discovery phase can help to define the challenge in a different way. Develop: Give different answers to the clearly defined problem, seeking inspiration from elsewhere and co-designing with a range of different people.   Deliver: Involves testing out different solutions at small-scale, rejecting those that will not work and improving the ones that will.},

  abstract = {Processes modeling is done for a number of reasons in relation to enterprise modeling, business process modeling and information systems development, and is a widely used technique. In particular after the introduction of BPR and workflow in the nineties, much work has looked on quality of business process models. In this paper we present a specialization of a general framework for assessing quality of models to support the evaluation the quality of business process models. The specialization takes earlier work on quality of models, process quality and quality of business process models into account. Comparing the approaches we find on the one hand that the properties of business process model quality is subsumed by the generic framework on a high level, and that there are aspects in this framework that are not covered by the existing work on business process model quality. On the other hand, the comparison has resulted in an extension of the generic framework for these kinds of models, and in this way improved the practical applicability of the framework when applied to discussing the quality of business process models. \textcopyright{} IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2012.},
