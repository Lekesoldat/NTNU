== Use Cases

Develop a number of use cases that are necessary to support the targeted business initiative. 
Start by a categorization of these based on the business function in which they belong if appropriate.

=== Prioritization of use cases on matrix
Place each of the use cases on the matrix and then develop a list of the sequence in which they will be addressed. 
Explain why you developed this ordering and why the sequence makes sense.
